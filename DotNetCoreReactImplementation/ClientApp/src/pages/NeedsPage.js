                ​Meet Jorge. <br /> Jorge currently does not have access to food
                or prescription medicine. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, he
                cannot leave the house because he is immunocompromised.​

                Jorge is just one of the millions of men, women and children who
                are struggling to get food, medicine, and basic services.
